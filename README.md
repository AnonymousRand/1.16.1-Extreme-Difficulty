# 1.16.1-Extreme-Difficulty

**Spigot servers, version 1.16.1**

**Java version 14**

**Warning: plugin is pretty heavyweight, do not run on a server with low RAM allocation**

# Installation instructions:

1. Click on "Releases" near the right side of the screen
2. Download the jar file from the release you want under the "Assets" tab (unlike with modded clients, you do not need to download the source code zip files; those only provide the code for the mod and not the runnable file itself)
3. Put the jar file into your plugin folder in your server folder
4. Run your server

This is a plugin made with Spigot NMS and Bukkit API.
